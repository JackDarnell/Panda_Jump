# Panda_Jump
A game similar to flappy bird about jumping over boulders as a panda :)

### Background 
Early in highschool I learned how to make iOS apps and I thought it would be fun to make a simple iOS app similar to Flappy Bird. Panda Jump is very simple, just tap the screen to jump over boulders as many boulders as you can and attempt to get a highscore. All of the sprites are either designed by me or some of my friends from virginia. Lots of inside jokes from when I was in highschool are included in the game for fun. 

### Screenshots


### Features
- Currency system where each boulder jumped over gives the player one unit of currency (I picked a random currency symbol on the top right).
- Character selection and purchasing.
- Sound bytes for jumping over boulders and other noises.
- Sprite effects such as fire when a user surpasses their highscore.
- Gamecenter leaderboards to track how you stack up against friends.
- Banner ad at the top using google adsense (not much of a feature but a cool thing I learned).
