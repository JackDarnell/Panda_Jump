# Panda_Jump
A game similar to flappy bird about jumping over boulders as a panda :)

### Background 
Early in highschool I learned how to make iOS apps and I thought it would be fun to make a simple iOS app similar to Flappy Bird. Panda Jump is very simple, just tap the screen to jump over as many boulders as you can and attempt to get a highscore. All of the sprites are either designed by me or some of my friends from Virginia. Lots of inside jokes from when I was in highschool are included in the game for fun. 

### Screenshots

### Features
- Currency system where each boulder jumped over gives the player one unit of currency (I picked a random currency symbol on the top right).
- Character selection and purchasing.
- Sound bytes for jumping over boulders and other noises.
- Sprite effects such as fire when a user surpasses their highscore.
- Gamecenter leaderboards to track how you stack up against friends.
- Banner ad at the top using google adsense (not much of a feature but a cool thing I learned).
- Funny/encouraging text pops up when the user successfully jumps over a boulder

### Next Steps
- Get computer running screen working and set it as the game start screen to help users understand how to to play.
- Integrate computer running screen and regular game screen so it is seamless when a user presses to start. 

### Bugs and Issues
- Issue with sound, not sure if it is just in the simulator or if it happens on device. No audio out.
- Crash when opening character, seems to be an issue with updating swift to the latest version or running the app on newer iOS versions.
- Price of last character doesn't show up, guessing it is an array index issue but need to look into it further.
- Gamecenter down, need dev license
